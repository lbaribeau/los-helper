### Twerp the Human Vicar just entered the Lands of Stone.

[36mThe Chapel of Healing

[37mThe chapel is favoured by all who pass through the town of Amethyst.
The healers here practice their art on any who need it as often as
necessary. As a result the place has acquired a neutral territory status
and none will raise arms to another while in here. The arched door is
magical and only a cleric may enter it which seems fair enough as it is
their place, but the silver portal is a mystery to most. The clerics seem
to know its purpose but refuse to discuss it.
[32mObvious exits: arched door, out, silver portal, chamber.
