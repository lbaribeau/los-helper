# Travel the track, killing the kill list
# Rest at the end of each track (go to chapel)
# This is really a travel bot, isn't it
# There are blocking mobs, there is chasing
# There is a bit of a mobs attacking list problem
# You run the track until a certain point, then you go rest, right
# Maybe do your shopping etc. before resting

# rest in chapel
# go sell
# go pawn
# maintain equipment
# buy 2 bottle, 2 milky, 2 misty if out
# find enemy
#  - buff up (pray, drink the three pots)
#  - fight enemy
#  -- if it fled, chase it down
#  -- if we fled, check if we can get to a rest node, if not, rest there and watch for attackers
#  - maintain equipment

# maintain equipment
# - check armour -- repair / buy --- (sell/pawn on way if passing closer than chapel - pawn - tip)
# - check weapons -- repair / buy
# -- have one extra
# -- Bonus points for repairing both at the same time

# Going anywhere
# if blocked - fight
# if mob attacking (not necessarily blocking) - fight
# - if you aim at it and it's not there, remove it from the list... right
# Cartography as we go
