I found that Pydev Package Explorer -> Rt Click los-helper -> New -> Pydev Module 
was not working because none of my folders were configured as source folders.

There was no 'package' icon in the main folder.

Perhaps there was a smarter way to import the project.

Anyway, the fix was to add a couple of lines to my .project file in my 
eclipseworkspace/los-helper 
directory 
(which had been created with svn co \
https://los-helper.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ los-helper --username laurierbaribeau)


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<?eclipse-pydev version="1.0"?>

<pydev_project>
	<pydev_property name="org.python.pydev.PYTHON_PROJECT_INTERPRETER">Default</pydev_property>
	<pydev_property name="org.python.pydev.PYTHON_PROJECT_VERSION">python 2.6</pydev_property>
	<!-- Added the following to allow creation of modules
	<pydev_pathproperty name="org.python.pydev.PROJECT_SOURCE_PATH">
		<path>/los-helper/main</path>
	</pydev_pathproperty>
	-->
</pydev_project>

This is done on new projects if you select the check box to add it to the
python path.  (That is how I figured this out)

Summary: If you want to be able to use Eclipse's Add Pydev Module, you might need 
to add the above XML segment (pydev_pathproperty element) to your 
los-helper/.project.
