Bug for kobold guards... won't continue to engage if health is low!
blocks your exit
 The 'x' attacks you.
 You attack the 'x'.
Debug:
 1. mobs joining in
 2. mobs who block
 3. not fighting in presence of guard . found one bug (re.match)

"sell silver ring" will sell a silver chalice...
 Solution... when doing inventory give everything a good enough name.
 still needs to avoid all unusable words.  (test: "silver ring", "tiny silver vial")
"Small mace" -> "small restorative" ... fixed if mace is removed on
    successful sales... this would be very good to do.

town guards. Done.  Reworked top level algorithm.

make flee stop the bot. 

Bot equips weapon on these triggers
Your x breaks and you have to remove it.
Your x shatters.

Wearing rings
Your x falls apart. (armour)

Maintain only ONE monster list.  MUD_thread will generally be
the only one to add/delete from it. DONE
The bot will go from this list.
However if the bot sees a problem, such as "You don't see that here",
then the bot can remove that mob from the list.  However the MUD thread will
have to be involved in that anyway.
Example bug:
       #Obvious exits: north, south, east.
       #You see a shopper.
       #MUD_READ: successful go
       #Check for successful go, returning True
       #Inside check_for_monsters
       #[52 H 21 M]: The shopper just wandered to the north.
       #Inside decide_which_mob_to_kill
       #Inside engage_monster... engaging shopper
       #[52 H 21 M]: You don't see that here.
       #[52 H 21 M]: Inside get_items
       #Inside check_weapons.
       #Inside engage_mobs_who_joined_in
       #[]
       #Inside heal_up
       #Inside decide_which_mob_to_kill
       #Inside engage_monster... engaging shopper
       #There's nothing here.
       #[52 H 21 M]: You don't see that here.

BUG... someone else kills my old mob:
"Your enemy, the shepherd had been defeated"
while I'm healing up and stops the cast thread,
or I'm in combat and stop fighting.
 Edit the combat thread stopping logic to compare the kk target to the mob
 that died.
PLAN:  (two fixes)
 1.  keep track of which mob you are kk ing and cc ing and only stop
     kk and cc if the mob that died was your target. 
 2.  engage mobs that attack you.  (DONE)
COMPLETED: I changed the trigger that stops combat and casting to 
"Your attack overwhelms the ..."
when a mob is killed so that should solves the above bugs.
   
Bug: When dual wielding the same weapon... when it breaks he 
will try to put it in his off hand every time... i suppose he needs a 
way to check which one broke!
Fix: Could not check which weapon broke.  Just enter both commands
wie' and 'seco' and hope for the best.
