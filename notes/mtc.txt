Hello,

Thanks for hearing me.  Mostly I believe I'd like help with my work ethic.  I held an engineering job doing control systems (mostly software,) a few years ago and burned out.

I think I have a sort of depression which I've been managing with jogging - if I miss my run I sink back down within about four days.  My marriage failed a bit over a year ago.  I might need to work on this a bit and could use some more depression tips. 

I'm trying to figure out what to do with my life.  I have a few choices - going back home to Saskatoon, finding a software job and trying to make life work here, doing an M Sc in astrophysics, or playing trombone with a cruise line.  I think I need to deal with some inner stuff in order to care about life and could use some coaching.  I haven't been able to make a decision that sticks.
