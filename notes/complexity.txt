I'm trying to pinpoint the complexity that I want to get rid of and helps me to 
think in writing...

(I am in the middle of writing the Inventory object and need to know how 
everything should be scoped.)

I think the crux of it is that I don't want BotThread to have to worry at all
about any of the mechanics of getting information.

I think this means I should decouple the dependency on the Character object, 
as well as from MudReaderHandler.  It used to be worse (before MudReaderHandler)
but the bot still has too much to worry about.  His thread needs to wait for 
the inventory to update but that 'wait' operation should happen within 
Inventory.getList(), out of the scope of the BotThread.

For now though the bot will still need the character object.  I'm not sure how 
this will look at the end of time, maybe everything will look like the Inventory
object will look but maybe not.

Another thought is that dynamic data should be distinguished from constants in 
the character object.
