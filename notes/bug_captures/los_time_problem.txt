
The problem is that the system clock can be set in the background which messes up timeout checks such as the ones in the MudReaderHandler.  

What steps will reproduce the problem?

Try 

import time
start_time = time.time()
while(True):
    run_time = time.time() - start_time
    print run_time
    time.sleep(5)

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

This should print the times increasing by exactly 5 seconds each print.  Any number of things may affect it by on my system it sometimes.  More rarely it changes by 20 seconds or more.  I have seen this with the bot running.  It showed up for me in check_for_successful_go and the bot believed that he could not travel and he began spamming the same exit over and over.  


Solutions:
Turning off auto synchronization with internet time server seems to help.  However it would be nice to have a more robust solution.
Perhaps a time module which did not depend on the system clock.
